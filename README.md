## Vendor Performance Data Analytics Project

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance using an end-to-end data analytics approach. The objective is to evaluate vendors based on sales, cost, profit, and delivery performance to support data-driven business decisions. The project demonstrates practical usage of SQL, Python, and Power BI to convert raw data into meaningful business insights.

# Objectives

* Analyze vendor sales and purchase data
* Measure vendor profitability and delivery efficiency
* Identify top-performing and underperforming vendors
* Build interactive dashboards and analytical reports
* Apply real-world data analytics workflow

# Tools and Technologies

* SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
* Python
* Power BI
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

# Dataset Description

The dataset includes vendor-level transactional data containing:

* Vendor ID
* Sales Amount
* Purchase Amount
* Delivery Time
* Transaction Date

Derived fields created during analysis:

* Total Sales
* Total Cost
* Profit
* Profit Margin
* Average Delivery Time

# Project Workflow

# Data Collection

Raw vendor data was collected in CSV format and imported into a SQL database for structured analysis.

# SQL Analysis

SQL queries were used to:

* Aggregate vendor-wise sales and purchase data
* Calculate profit and performance metrics
* Generate summary tables for analysis

# Data Cleaning Using Python

* Removed duplicate records
* Handled missing values
* Corrected data types
* Created calculated columns such as profit and margin

# Exploratory Data Analysis

* Performed statistical analysis on vendor performance
* Analyzed revenue and cost distribution
* Identified trends, patterns, and outliers
* Visualized insights using charts

# Power BI Dashboard

* Developed an interactive dashboard
* Created KPIs for sales, cost, profit, and delivery time
* Implemented slicers and filters for dynamic analysis
* Enabled vendor comparison views

# Reporting

A final analytical report was prepared including:

* Executive summary
* Key insights
* Dashboard visuals
* Business recommendations

# Key KPIs

* Total Revenue
* Total Purchase Cost
* Total Profit
* Profit Margin Percentage
* Average Delivery Time
